# 0.3.3 #

# 0.3.2 #

This is a maintenance release that fixes a NullPointerException that may occur when an application logs a null message.

# 0.3.1 #

WebSphere plug-ins:
  * Solved [issue #5](https://code.google.com/p/xm4was/issues/detail?id=#5): ensure that log events generated by a filter are correctly classified if the request is routed to a static page or a JSP.
  * The extended logging service has been improved:
    * It is now able to identify the source of log events emitted by unmanaged threads.
    * It formats (or attempts to reformat) stack traces into a more readable form (that is also more suitable if there is a limit on the log message size).
  * Added PMI metrics to measure the VmSize and VmRSS values found in `/proc/<pid>/statm`.
  * Added PMI metrics to measure the number of minor and major page faults found in `/proc/<pid>/stat`.

JMX client connector:
  * Added a custom SSLSocketFactory that can be used to enable the signer exchange prompt for SOAP connections.

# 0.3.0 #

  * Added a PMI module that provides statistics about WebSphere's ZIP file cache.
  * Added a statistic to the class loader monitor PMI module that provides information about the resource request cache.
  * The PMI statistics can now be visualized in the performance viewer in the admin console. This already worked for stand-alone servers, but not on the deployment manager in a Network Deployment cell.

# 0.2.0 #

Adds MBean security:
  * The platform MXBeans are now secured (and require monitor or operator role, depending on the method).
  * The JRMP JMX connector now integrates with WebSphere's security system (authentication and authorization). Note however that SSL is not yet supported.

# 0.1.1 #
